# Process-Scheduling-Stimulator
Process Scheduler Simulator based on Priority and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithms using Python, coupled with the integration of the wxPython GUI for the user interface, has been a significant achievement in the realm of operating system simulation and education. This project aimed to provide a practical tool for understanding and visualizing the intricacies of process scheduling, and it has successfully met its objectives. Through this project, we have demonstrated the power of Python as a versatile programming language for system simulation and GUI development. The implementation of the Priority and SJF scheduling algorithms has allowed users to explore the impact of different scheduling policies on system performance. By providing a user-friendly interface built with wxPython, we have ensured that users of all backgrounds can easily interact with the simulator and gain insights into process scheduling.
